# `pycti-mcp`: An MCP Server for OpenCTI

An [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server front-end for [`pycti`](https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/client-python).

Inspired by [Spathodea-Network/opencti-mcp](https://github.com/Spathodea-Network/opencti-mcp), but rather than trying to reflect
OpenCTI content back to the caller, the aim here is to condense, normalize, and consolidate data from OpenCTI into JSON for
the LLM to consume in order to acheive the following improvements:

- More verbosity in field naming so the LLM can better intuit what a field represents
- Resolve parts of GraphQL-linked entities into the response so more context is available in a single MCP response
- Reduce the inclusion of non-informative metadata to reduce context window usage

To use:

1. Set `$OPENCTI_URL` and `$OPENCTI_KEY` to your OpenCTI URL and API Key, respectively. Or, you can provide these on the command-line.
2. Run `uvx pycti-mcp@latest [ ... any CLI args ... ]`

Usage details:

```plaintext
usage: pycti-mcp [-h] [-p PORT] [-s] [-v] [-u URL] [-k KEY]

Execute the OpenCTI MCP Server

options:
  -h, --help       show this help message and exit
  -p, --port PORT  TCP port to listen on (default 8002 - only used if -s/--sse is provided)
  -s, --sse        Start an SSE server (default: off)
  -v, --verbose    Run in VERBOSE mode (INFO level logging). Default: off (WARN level logging)
  -u, --url URL    OpenCTI URL - Can also be provided in OPENCTI_URL environment variable
  -k, --key KEY    OpenCTI API Key - Can also be provided in OPENCTI_KEY environment variable
```

## Usage with [mcp-hub](https://github.com/ravitemer/mcp-hub)

The packaging of this MCP server has been designed to work well with the [mcp-hub](https://github.com/ravitemer/mcp-hub) project. For more
details about it, you can visit its project page. MCP-Hub is popular for providing multi-MCP-server management to various
tools, such as NeoVim. To add this project to MCP-Hub, simply extend your `mcpServers` section in `~/.config/mcphub/servers.json`
with the following configuration, adjusting as necessary for your particular server/environment:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "OpenCTI": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "pycti-mcp@latest",
        "--url",
        "https://my.opencti.server",
        "--key",
        "${cmd: kwallet-query -r my-opencti-apikey -l kdewallet}"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Note that, in the above example, `mcp-hub` supports various types of variable/shell expansion in the JSON configuration file. In
the above example, [KWalletManager](https://apps.kde.org/kwalletmanager5/) (or similar) would have been used to manually populate
a password named `my-opencti-apikey` in the `kdewallet` wallet. The above code would trigger any required system-side authentication
prompts for secret retrieval, and keep the secret out of the JSON file. If, however, storing the API Key in your JSON file is acceptable
or preferable, you can simply make the API key the value of that field in the JSON.

If preferred, the `--url` and `--key` arguments can be left off, and an `env` section can be added to the configuration to
populate the `OPENCTI_URL` and `OPENCTI_KEY` environment vars, instead. Read the `mcp-hub` documentation for more details.

## Usage with VSCode

Similar to above, [VSCode Supports MCP Servers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers) as well. You
can add `pycti-mcp` using a config similar to this:

```json
{
  // Inputs are prompted on first server start, then stored securely by VS Code.
  "inputs": [
    {
      "type": "promptString",
      "id": "opencti-key",
      "description": "OpenCTI API Key",
      "password": true
    }
  ],
  "servers": {
    "OpenCTI": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "pycti-mcp@latest",
        "-u",
        "https://my.opencti.server",
        "-k",
        "${input:opencti-key"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

If preferred, the `--url` and `--key` arguments can be left off, and an `env` section can be added to the configuration to
populate the `OPENCTI_URL` and `OPENCTI_KEY` environment vars, instead. See the above VSCode documentation for more details.

# Adding New Tools

New tools may be added by creating a new Python module under [`src/pycti_mcp/pycti_tools/`](./src/pycti_mcp/pycti_tools/), then adding it
to the `__all__` list in [`./src/pycti_mcp/pycti_tools/__init__.py`](./src/pycti_mcp/pycti_tools/__init__.py) and to the
appropriate place in [`./tests/tools_list.txt`](./tests/tools_list.txt) so that the test suite can discover it during
code validation.

The only requirement is that your code
must implement exactly **one tool per module**, and the module must contain a `def tool_init(url, key)` function that takes the
OpenCTI url and API key as input (to save them internally for run-time use) and returns the function which is the entrypoint for the tool.
The entrypoint must implement the [Python Type Annotations](https://typing.python.org/en/latest/spec/annotations.html), which will be used
to provide an English-language description of how to call your tool, what it returns, and what its purpose is.

Example `generic_tool.py` below:

```python
from typing import Annotated
from pycti import OpenCTIApiClient

# Useful convention is to make a class implementation which holds the credentials provided to the tool
# from the call to tool_init(url, key)
class OpenCTIConfig:
    opencti_url = ""
    opencti_key = ""

def opencti_generic_tool(
    earliest: Annotated[str | None, "The earliest date of my search range"] = None,
    latest: Annotated[str | None, "The latest date of my search range"] = None,
    search: Annotated[str | None, "Search terms to filter on"] = None,
) -> Annotated[list | None, "Data structure listing the matching objects in the range"]:
    """Given a date range (start and end date) and some search terms, find all generic objects in the system
    matching the given criteria"""
    log = logging.getLogger(name=__name__)

    if not OpenCTIConfig.opencti_url:
        log.error("OpenCTI URL was not set. Tool will not work")
        return None

    # The credentials can be referenced by OpenCTIConfig.* as below
    octi = OpenCTIApiClient(
        url=OpenCTIConfig.opencti_url, token=OpenCTIConfig.opencti_key, ssl_verify=True
    )

    found_objs = []

    # TODO: Your implementation would go here, using the OpenCTI client to perform desired work
    ...

    ...

# Implement the tool_init that will be called by the MCP server to discover the available tool
def tool_init(url, key):
    # Note that it overwrites the default values in OpenCTIConfig.* with what was provided
    OpenCTIConfig.opencti_url = url
    OpenCTIConfig.opencti_key = key
    return opencti_reports_lookup
```

New tools need to be added to the following files in the project:

- [`./src/pycti_mcp/pycti_tools/__init__.py`](./src/pycti_mcp/pycti_tools/__init__.py) - Needs to be in the `__all__` list here to be auto-loaded
- [`./tests/tools_list.txt`](./tests/tools_list.txt) - Needs to be added to the list of tools, in alphabetical order, for the test suite to succeed

<summary>OpenCTI Indicator Lookup</summary>

**Name**: `opencti_indicator_lookup`

**Inputs**:

- `pattern_search_strings` (`list[str]`): A list of search terms that **all**
  must match in the `pattern` field of an indicator
- `pattern_types` (`list[str]`): A list of pattern types to search for,
  defined by the `indicator_type_ov` vocabulary in OpenCTI.
- `indicator_id` (`str`): The OpenCTI Id, a STIX Id, or the signature name of
  an indicator to retrieve, instead of searching

This tool can be used to search for one or more indicators (also called a signature or IOC) given a list of strings,
which will be used to perform a search within the indicator's pattern field (also known as the signature content or body).
It will search for any indicators in OpenCTI that contain all of the strings in pattern_search_strings, where the pattern
type (also called "signature type" or "indicator type" or "IOC type") are exactly any of the values specified in
pattern_types. If pattern_types is empty list ([]), then this tool will interpret that as an instruction to search across
all pattern types, even patterns that aren't specifically defined in the pattern_types definition.

If indicator_id is not None, then it must contain either a STIX Id or an OpenCTI Id to fetch an indicator, IOC,
signature, by Id rather than by searching. When used with indicator_id, this function will ignore the values of
pattern_search_strings and pattern_types, and return the indicator specified by the Id even if it doesn't match either of those
input parameters. The name of the indicator, such as its filename or signature name, can also be provided as the indicator_id.

This tool will return a list of the indicators (also known as signatures, IOCs, or patterns) that match the provided input.

- `signature`: The pattern of the indicator (the actual signature or IOC body as a string).
- `stix_id`: The STIX standard ID for the indicator.
- `opencti_id`: The internal OpenCTI entity ID for the indicator.
- `signature_type`: The type of signature/pattern (e.g., YARA, Sigma, Snort).
- `description`: A description of the indicator, if available.
- `created`: The creation timestamp of the indicator within OpenCTI.
- `last_updated`: The last time the indicator was updated in OpenCTI.
- `labels`: A list of labels (strings) attached to the indicator.
- `external_reports`: A list of related external references, each with:
  - `name`: The label for the report bundle (currently always 'Self').
  - `urls`: List of URLs for external references related to this indicator.
- `confidence`: Numeric OpenCTI confidence score for the indicator.
- `score`: The OpenCTI-specific score or priority for the indicator (may not always be present).
- `revoked`: Boolean indicating if the indicator has been revoked.
- `deploy`: Boolean showing if the indicator is marked for production deployment (OpenCTI detection flag).
- `mitre_platforms`: List of MITRE ATT&CK platforms this indicator targets or is associated with.
- `observables`: List of observable values referenced by this indicator. Each entry contains:
  - `value`: The observable value (e.g., domain, hash, IP, etc.).
  - `type`: The observable type (e.g., 'ipv4-addr', 'file:hashes.SHA256').
